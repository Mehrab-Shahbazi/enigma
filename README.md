# Enigma Machine Simulator

This project is a simple simulation of the historic Enigma machine used for encryption. It provides a basic implementation of rotors, a reflector, and the stepping mechanism to encode and decode messages.

## About

The code simulates the core functionality of the Enigma machine, allowing users to encode messages by passing them through rotors and a reflector. This project is created for fun and as a hobbyist exploration into classical cryptography.

## Features

- Rotor and reflector simulation
- Stepping mechanism with double-stepping behavior
- Encoding of alphabetic messages preserving case insensitivity
- Simple interface to encode entire messages

## Future Work

- Integrate a deep learning model to explore automated decryption or pattern recognition in Enigma-encoded texts
- Improve rotor configuration and ring settings customization
- Add GUI for better user interaction

## Usage

To use the Enigma machine simulator, create rotor and reflector instances with their wiring and initialize the `EnigmaMachine` class. Then call `encode_message()` with the message you want to encode or decode.
